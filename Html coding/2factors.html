		<h3> Factors Influencing Adolescents' Body Image </h3>

		<article class="factor1"> 

		<b> 1) Traditional Media </b>

		<p> From a young age, many children are exposed to messages that, if internalized, may lead to a negative body image. These messages include sociocultural body ideals that often portray skinny women and muscular men as the “ideal” shape. Until not too long ago, these are predominantly the kind of beauty messages being sent through media, and many are concerned that the pressures of having the “ideal” body may lead to poor body image in children and adolescents. </p>

		<p> There are indeed some truths to this concern, but it all boils down to the internalization of those ideals. It seems that awareness of the ideals alone may not negatively affect adolescents’ body image until internalization occurs. In other words, the beauty ideals may lead to body dissatisfaction only if it is being integrated into one’s sense of self and values. This may explain why not everyone who is exposed to the same beauty standards through the media may develop an unhealthy body image. </p>

		<p> Unsurprisingly, girls show higher internalization of these ideals, which may partly explain the higher prevalence of body dissatisfaction among girls than boys. On the contrary, the internalization of sociocultural ideals does not have a significant impact on body image in boys.</p>

		 <b> 2) Social Media </b>

		 <p> Social media seems to have a unique influence on adolescents’ body image. In general, there is a positive correlation between social media use and body dissatisfaction, both among boys and girls. Although it is impossible to draw causation, social media use seems to predict body dissatisfaction than the other way around. </p>

		 <p> There are many possible explanations for this including internalization of beauty ideals, appearance comparison, and the pressure to “look perfect” on social media. Indeed, evidence suggests that people who use social media more are also more likely to internalize beauty ideals, as well as to compare their appearance with other people on social media. They are also more likely to report feeling the pressure to “look perfect” on social media, all of which can contribute to poor body image. </p>

		<b> 3) Parents and Peers </b>

		</p>

		 <p> Moessages and perceived messages from parents and close friends also have a big influence on adolescents’ body image, as well as their attitudes surrounding eating and weight. Parents and close friends are also strong predictors of the kind of body-change strategies adolescents are likely to adopt. For boys, the use of weight-loss and muscle-increasing strategies are heavily influenced by messages from parents, particularly from fathers, whilst messages from mothers and best friends have the strongest effects on the strategies utilized by girls. </p>
