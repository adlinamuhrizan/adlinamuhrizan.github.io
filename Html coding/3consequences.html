		<h3> Consequences of Poor Body Image  </h3>

		<section>

		<p> OK, so many adolescents have an unhealthy body image and are dissatisfied with their bodies. Why does this matter? </p>

		<p> There are many reasons why this is an issue. Having a poor body image is associated with a variety of negative consequences including: </p>

		<ul>
			<li> <b> Unhealthy eating habits </b> - Many studies found that body dissatisfaction may lead to unhealthy eating habits. This includes fasting, dieting, vomiting after eating, and using diet pills, which are utilized by more than half of high school girls to lose weight. Moreover, dieting behaviors in early adolescence is also a risk factor for eating disorders. </li>

		</ul>

		<ul>

			<li> <b> Depression </b> - Having a poor body image predicts elevated risk for depressive symptoms, which may persist until adulthood. </li>

		</ul>

		<ul>

			<li> <b> Low Self-Esteem </b> - Poor body image is also associated with low self-esteem. </li>

		</ul>

		<ul>	

			<li> <b> Substance Use </b> - Body dissatisfaction is also linked to increased smoking and drinking among adolescents. </li> 

		</ul>

		<p> The bottom line is, having a negative body image makes adolescents more vulnerable to many psychological and physical problems such as disordered eating and depression. As an adult/parent, we have a responsibility to look for the best interests of the younger generation, promoting a positive body image is one way we can do to help foster healthy development during adolescents. </p>
