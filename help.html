		<h2> How Parents Can Help </h2>

		<p> Parents and media are among the most important factors influencing adolescent’s body image. With that in mind, below are some of the ways parents can help promote positive body image in adolescents. There are also many reliable websites providing useful parenting resources that parents can utilize on their journey to promote healthy body image to their children, such as the <a href="https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/healthy-lifestyle/body-image/body-image-teens"> raisingchildren.net.au </a>. </p>

			<dt> Talk to your child about bodies and body image </dt>

			<dd> Discuss with your child about what is a “normal” and healthy body vs. what is not, and that the social body “ideals” are not the normative look for everyone. Studies suggest that enhancing parent-child communication surrounding this topic might contribute to a healthier weight and increased body satisfaction. In contrast, strained or awkward parent-child communication, especially with fathers, is associated with body dissatisfaction among both male and female adolescents. Communication is key! </dd>

			<dt> Teach your child to be media literate </dt>

			<dd> Adolescents nowadays live in a media-saturated world, and there are no limits to what kind of messages adolescents might be exposed to on daily basis. With all kinds of information at hand, adolescents must be adequately equipped with media literacy skills, such as the ability to critically access and evaluate media content. Among the things, parents can discuss with their child include the unhealthy body images that are perpetuated in the media, as well as the marketing strategy that may target an audience with body dissatisfaction. Indeed, evidence suggests that media literacy can be a protective factor against the negative effects of social media on adolescents’ body image. </dd>
