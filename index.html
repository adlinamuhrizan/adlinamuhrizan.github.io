			<h2> Overview </h2>

			<p> A person’s body image is how they think and feel about their body. This may include what they believe about their appearance in their mind, which may or may not reflect their true shape and size. In general, one can have a positive body image, meaning that they are satisfied with their body, or negative body image, meaning they are unhappy with the way they look. Having a positive body image is a rather important part of mental and physical well-being, whereas having a negative body image is associated with many negative consequences including depression and disordered eating.</p>

			<p> The prevalence of body image dissatisfaction among adolescents is particularly concerning: Estimates vary by different studies due to sampling difference, for example, 60.4% among Brazilian adolescents and 36.7% among adolescents in UAE, but the statistics, nonetheless, show that body dissatisfaction is, indeed, of high prevalence among adolescence worldwide. </p>

However, this does not mean that boys do not experience body dissatisfaction – they do have body image concerns as well, though there are important sex differences in body dissatisfaction among boys than girls. </p>
